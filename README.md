# Roboanimator â€“ CSV to Plots (Browser Based)

This tool lets you open the CSV files exported by the [Roboanimator Blender add-on](https://extensions.blender.org/approval-queue/true-roboanimator/) and quickly visualize the data in your browser.  
No installation needed â€” just upload your CSV and explore the plots.

## How to Use
1. Open the https://danyals-code.github.io/Roboanimator-CSV-to-Browser-Based-Plots/.  
2. Upload the CSV file generated by the Blender add-on.  
3. Adjust options if needed:
   - **skiprows** â†’ number of lines to ignore at the top of the file. (Default: `2`)  
   - **Tire radius (m)** â†’ enter wheel radius to show speed in meters/second. Leave blank to use average RPM.  
4. Click **Render Plots**.  
5. Three interactive plots will be shown:
   - XY path colored by speed  
   - 3D path vs speed  
   - XY path with animated marker (time slider)  

You can zoom, pan, rotate, and hover on all charts.

## CSV Format
The CSV should contain at least these columns:

t, x_m, y_m, rateR_rpm, rateL_rpm

- `t` â†’ time in seconds  
- `x_m, y_m` â†’ positions in meters  
- `rateR_rpm, rateL_rpm` â†’ wheel speeds in RPM  

The Blender add-on exports files in this format by default.

## Notes
- Everything runs locally in your browser; your data is not uploaded anywhere.  
- Works best on desktop with a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).  
- If plots donâ€™t render:
  - Try changing **skiprows** (some files need 1 or 3 instead of 2).  
  - Make sure the CSV includes the required columns.

## Development
This project is a single HTML file using:  
- [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/) for interactive charts  
- [PapaParse](https://www.papaparse.com/) for CSV parsing  

You can fork or clone the repo, edit `index.html`, and push changes. GitHub Pages will update automatically.
