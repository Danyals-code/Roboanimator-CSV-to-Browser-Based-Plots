# Roboanimator â€“ CSV to Plots (Browser App)

This is a simple **in-browser visualizer** for CSV files generated by the Roboanimator Blender add-on.  
You donâ€™t need to install Python or any packages â€” everything runs directly in your browser using Plotly.js.

## How to Use
1. Go to the [live app link](https://daniel2529.github.io/Roboanimator---CSV-to-plots/).  
2. Click **Choose File** and upload the CSV exported from the Blender add-on.  
3. Enter optional parameters:
   - **skiprows** â†’ Number of lines to ignore at the top of the file.  
     (Default is `2`, because your CSVs usually have 2 metadata lines before the header.)
   - **Tire radius (m)** â†’ Enter your wheel radius in meters if you want speed in m/s.  
     If left blank, speed will be shown as average RPM.
4. Click **Render Plots**.  
5. Three interactive plots will appear:
   - **XY Path (colored by speed)**  
   - **3D Path vs Speed**  
   - **XY Path with animated marker (time slider)**  

You can **zoom, pan, rotate, and hover** on all charts.
